########### Numerical iterations ###########

iterations_m.py
Python code implementing numerical iterations of eqns. (8a-c).



########### Individual-based simulations (coded in C) ###########

m_shift.cpp 
The evolution of maternal effects in an environment that is characterized by a rapid environmental shift

m_sin.cpp 
The evolution of maternal effects in a periodically fluctuating environment 

m_size.cpp 
The evolution of maternal effects in a periodically fluctuating environment in which the phenotype is size, trading off against fecundity 

and two bash files run_m_*.sh illustrating the use of the command line parameters


Code ran on an Ubuntu Linux machine with the GNU Scientific Library installed. 
Compile as follows:
g++ -Wall -o m_shift m_shift.cpp -lm -lrt -lgsl -lgslcblas
Should, in principle, also be able to work on a windows machine with MinGW and GnuWin32 installed: http://www.mingw.org/ 

50000 generations should take less than 10 minutes. The m_size is much slower, as it relies on producing a large number of offspring
